# WiFi-Saved-Passwords
Displays saved WiFi passwords on your Windows machine.

## Information
This tool displays saved WiFi passwords that the user has at one point connected to. I came across two CMD commands and figured I should automate the process instead; manually doing it is very inefficient and time consumable.
